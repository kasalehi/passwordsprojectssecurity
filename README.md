This is one of my favorite projects for checking whether our passwords are secure. In today's world, security plays a crucial role in the industry, as hackers are constantly scraping and hacking data.

This fun project demonstrates how we can build and apply an app to check the security of our passwords for our staff or stackholders. If you don't have time to write code, I highly recommend using the "Have I Been Pwned?" website to verify your username and password security.

Steps to run:
Create a virtual environment (venv).
Activate the virtual environment.
Create a .py file.
Copy the code and open your terminal (Bash, PowerShell, or CMD).

 * copy the file and open your terminal (bash-powershell or cmd)
 * run file using following command (**python pass.py your_password**)
