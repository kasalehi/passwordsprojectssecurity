This is one of my most faviourte projects in order to check whether our passwords is secure or not.
security is playing important role in industry nowdays as most hackers are ready to scapting , ahcking data. 
This fun project shows how can we apply and create the app to check how is our password is secure. If you dont have time to write codes, highly suggest you  to check you user and security passwords using website "have been pwabed?"

steps to run:
 * create venv
 * activate ven
 * create .py file
 * copy the file and open your terminal (bash-powershell or cmd)
 * run file using following command (python pass.py **your_password**)
